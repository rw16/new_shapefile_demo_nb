The files to use, `Chicago_georef.tif`, `Chicago_georef.tfw`, `Chicago_georef.tif.aux.xml`, and `Chicago_georef.tif.ovr` are stored in the `Georef_Tiff` folder. Although the data for time image are stored in four different files (and each of these files are needed!), to ArcMap it will look like one image. \n",

You could have another field for `Established` which could contain the date each park was founded, or `Jurisdiction` which would indicate which neighborhood the park belonged to.
